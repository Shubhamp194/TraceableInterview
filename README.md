# TraceableInterview
This is the project I made in Traceable Interview

# To run this 
1. clone this reop
2. build docker images
    command - docker build -t traceable-image
3. If you don't have myql image, down it
4. Run docker-compose file
    command - docker-compose up. (you can add -d at the end to run int detach mode)
5. To stop the container
    command - docker-compose down
